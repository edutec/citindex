It is designed to make client-side development faster and easier.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nAmber is written in itself, including the parser and compiler. Amber compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping one-to-one with the equivalent JavaScript. There is no interpretation at runtime.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n-    Amber features an IDE with a Class browser, Workspace, Transcript, a ReferencesBrowser supporting senders/implementors and class references, basic Inspector and even a beginning of a Debugger and a unit TestRunner.\n-    [Pharo Smalltalk](http://www.pharo-project.org) is considered as the reference implementation.\n-    Amber includes a canvas to generate HTML, like [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st)\n-    Amber can use Javascript libraries and the current IDE is built on [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)\n-    You can inline Javascript code and there are many ways to interact between Amber and Javascript\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nAmber is released under the MIT license. All contributions made for inclusion are considered to be under MIT.\n\nBuilding Amber\n--------------\n\nThis step is only used by people developing Amber itself.\nPlease refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.\nIt explains the Amber development setup and how to contribute.\n\n\nMore infos\n----------\n\nMore on the [project page](http://amber-lang.net)\n",
